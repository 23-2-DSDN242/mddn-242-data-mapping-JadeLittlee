The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

# A Cat's Life by Jade Little
## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

As this project was focused on creating an AI camera based of a theme that is personal to me, I have chosen to focus on my cat, Felicity. The theme is 'A Cat's Life'. The objective was to showcase how cat's have it easy in life, and don't have many worries in the world – unlike us humans. My cat is constantly sleeping on our beds, and in/on blankets. She has two sides to her, a sassy side, and a very sweet loving side. For this project, since I wanted to highlight a cat's chill life, I've decided to play off of Felicity's sweet side. Therefore, I'm aiming to apply a softness to Felicity, and probably the rest of the image, but keeping the halo around her bright, and perhaps soften the edges to blend in with the background.

For the AI-generated masks, I had success straight away when inputing images and masks of just my cat. The AI was able to successfully identify that I wanted to hightlight just my cat, and not anything else in the background. Just highlighting a cat was quite a simple idea for an AI camera, as if the AI saw any cat it would apply the custom pixel design I've created to all the cats. I didn't want a simple and boring AI camera – in terms of what wasnrecognised by the AI – therefore, I decided to train the AI to recognise just my cat Felicity. So, if I were to use this AI camera to scan over multiple cats, then my custom pixel design would just be applied to Felicity. Since this project is centered on photographs/themes within photographs that are important to me, it makes more sense to have the AI camera just recognise my cat, as she is very important to me. 

To create this AI camera I had to photoshop other photos of cats – that I had, and some images from online – with my cat. I then created masks of just my cat in each of the photoshopped images with multiple cats in them – in the hope that the AI would generate a mask of just my cat in the fourth image that I inputed. This experiment worked really well on the first go, as the AI was able to work out what I wanted it to go, and therefore created a mask of just my cat in the image I inputed – not the other cat in the background. 

For the stylistic features of my custom pixel design, I knew I wanted a halo around Felicity. I tried creating a yellow halo around her originally using large ellipses behind the mask of my cat. This worked and looked like a halo, but it was very flat in colour. Instead, I wanted the halo to glow, so I have decided that I need to start at white at the center of my cat, and progressing out into yellow at different transparency's. The yellow starts really light and translucent and gets more opaque the closer to the border of the halo you get – but the yellow is never fully opaque, to help with the glowing look. The halo is made up of ellipses all starting at the center of my cat and getting larger (larger circumfrance) each time to form the glowing halo. 

I tried out this halo idea that I've stated above. I was going to have the halo be behind the whole of Felicity, but as I was working on this halo, I quite liked how the halo was looking when it didn't go behind the whole of my cat. Instead, the halo covers 3/4 of her. At this point the colours of the halo needed further tweaking, so that I was able to achieve the glowing effect I wanted. 

As I stated above, I wanted felicity to have a softness to her, but when I intially started creating my pixelation design I wasn't achieving that softness. I started using small horizontal lines that showcased where where felicity was in the picture, but these lines were too harsh – so didn't exemplify the softness I aimed for – but it was good to try out using lines initially to understand the coding framework. Therefore, I switched over to ellipses at about 30pt, but these were all very opaque and weren't quite looking right. The ellipses were softer than the lines, but still looked too harsh. I decided to see what 10pt ellipses looked like, and these were better than the 30pt ellipses, at achieving my aim, but still not quite right. What I hoped to do from here, was to mess around with the opacity of the ellipses to get more of a blurry effect to create a soft look. 

For the background, at this point I just had the background grayed out as I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with the background yet.
